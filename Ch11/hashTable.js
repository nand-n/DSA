 Hash table is exelent for qucik storage and retricval of data based on
 key - kalue parirs. 
 In js Objects works on defining a key (propery) and its associated value

{/**
    The most important part of hashing is the hash function 
    THe hashing function converts a specific key into an index for an array 
    that stores all of the data.
    THe three primary requirments for good hash function are 
        1, Deterministic : Equal keys produce equal hash values 
        2, Efficency : it should be O(1) in time complexity 
        3, Uniform distribution L it makes the most use of the array
